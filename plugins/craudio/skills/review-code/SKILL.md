Review the code I've selected or the recent changes for:
- Potential bugs or edge cases
- Security concerns (injection, auth issues, data exposure)
- Performance issues (unnecessary allocations, N+1 queries, missing indexes)
- Readability improvements (naming, structure, complexity)

Be concise and actionable. Group findings by severity (critical, warning, suggestion).
